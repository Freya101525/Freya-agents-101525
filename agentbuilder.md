Hi please create a detailed instructions for beginner for using OpenAI agent builder to develop a agentic system to conduct following tasks: user will decide how many doc to provide then user can upload or paste doc (txt, markdown, pdf). Then if upload doc is pdf, user will device what pages to ocr then system will transform to markdown with keywords in coral color. Then system will combine all docs into a markdown doc (keep all original information) with keywords in coral color. System will create a comprehensive summary in markdown for the previous doc and a word graph visualization. System will also create a 100 unique entities in a table in markdown from the previous doc. Then user will decide how many agents to use from agents.yaml then modify the prompt and related parameter before execute the agent one by one. Please add another feature that user can paste another doc (txt or markdown), system will transform the doc into markdown (article 2) with key words in coral color. Then system will create relationship of article 2 and previous doc for mind-map. User can modify the relationship and then system will create interactive mind map using tannerbohn, pygraphviz, graphviz. User can modify the relationship to update the interactive mind map. This system is deployed on share streamlit, using streamlit, Gemini API (gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-2.5-flash-lite), OpenAI API (chatgpt-5-mini, chatgpt-5-nano, chatgpt-4o-mini, chatgpt-4.1-mini), agents.yaml. Ending with follow up questions.
